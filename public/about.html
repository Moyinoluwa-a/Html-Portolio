<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! <p></p>Iâ€™m Moyinoluwa, a computer science(technology) student.
<br />
 My journey hasnâ€™t been easyâ€”like many, Iâ€™ve struggled with self-confidence and finding my direction. But through perseverance and a deep interest in tech, Iâ€™ve found my path and am excited to help others do the same.
<br />
  Iâ€™m currently diving deep into software development, working on exciting projects that allow me to apply what Iâ€™m learning in real-world scenarios. 
  <br />
  Iâ€™m particularly passionate about supporting young people, especially women, who might feel unsure about their place in the tech world. 
  <br />I believe in creating opportunities and fostering a supportive environment where everyone can thrive and succeed. I want to inspire others with my journey and show that with determination, anything is possible.
